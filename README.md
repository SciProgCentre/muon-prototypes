# SIMBA prototyping

This repository contains prototyping ideas for SIMBA (Bayesian platform for particle physics simulations). There are several directions in which we have specific interest.

We recommend to use `conda` for `python` and `C/C++` development. You can rely on the provided environment:
```
$ conda env create -f env.yml
$ conda activate simba 
```

## Muography 

For a nice introduction to muography we point out the survey by [L. Bonechi et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03934).
The wonderful paper by [W. Trzaska et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00868) discusses further experimental aspects.

Our starting point is [pumas](https://github.com/niess/pumas), a `C99` library for backward Monte-Carlo simulations of muons passing through matter, specifically designed for muography. 


As a first task, we propose to investigate the differential cross-sections in `pumas v1.0`. 
We shall consider the 
[bremsstrahlung](https://github.com/niess/pumas/blob/d04dce6388bc0928e7bd6912d5b364df4afa1089/src/pumas.c#L9155), 
[pair production](https://github.com/niess/pumas/blob/d04dce6388bc0928e7bd6912d5b364df4afa1089/src/pumas.c#L9221),
[photonuclear](https://github.com/niess/pumas/blob/d04dce6388bc0928e7bd6912d5b364df4afa1089/src/pumas.c#L9515) 
and
[ionisation](https://github.com/niess/pumas/blob/d04dce6388bc0928e7bd6912d5b364df4afa1089/src/pumas.c#L9620) 
processes for muons. 
Those calculations have been also implemented in [noa](https://github.com/grinisrit/noa), 
see the [docs](https://github.com/grinisrit/noa/blob/master/docs/pms/muons.ipynb) for more information. 

Your first tasks can be:  

 * Re-implement the calculations in `python` using [numba](https://colab.research.google.com/github/cbernet/maldives/blob/master/numba/numba_cuda.ipynb) on both `CPU` and `CUDA` (we advise you to integrate `numba` with `pytorch`, cf. [examples](https://gist.github.com/grinisrit/280e4f14b17fe5ee37e2e254700d9fd0)).Â 
 * In a `jupyter` notebook, provide the exact formulas for the cross-sections used (you can have a look at [MUM](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0010322) for initial reference).
 * Compare accuracy and performance across `CPU`/`CUDA` (document your results).

We recommend the Oxford lecture [notes](https://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Passage.pdf) 
on the passage of particles through matter and 
the [PENELOPE](https://www.oecd-nea.org/science/docs/2011/nsc-doc2011-5) manual 
as a good introductory read about Monte-Carlo simulations. 
[Geant4](https://geant4-userdoc.web.cern.ch/UsersGuides/PhysicsReferenceManual/fo/PhysicsReferenceManual.pdf)
reference is also a useful resource.
Backward Monte-Carlo technique is well described by [V. Niess et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05636).

 For research directions in this project have a look at 
 this [tutorial](https://github.com/grinisrit/noa/blob/master/docs/pms/differentiable_programming_pms.ipynb) 
 on differentiable programming for particle physics simulations.
